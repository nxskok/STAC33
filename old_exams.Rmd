title: "Old exams"
---

This is the first time that STAC33 has been taught, so there are no old exams yet.

The style of the course is much like STAC32, so you will find [old STAC32 exams](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/old_exams.html) useful. You may also find the advice given on that page worth reading.
