#  Introduction to Applied Statistics

## Ken Butler

![bad picture](ken.jpg){width=400px}

Welcome to the home page for STAC33. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).

In this course, we learn R (and at the end SAS), and how to use this software for data organization and to apply statistical methods that you (mostly) already know. I emphasize the communication of the results. That is to say, you need to *get* the answers, but you also need to be able to *explain to others* what the results mean, and *convince others why* what you have done is sensible.

  I will direct you to problems in PASIAS that cover everything after what appears on Assignment 7.

- 2020-02-10 10:30: About the exam: *this is a written exam*. I will typically ask for one of two kinds of answer: code to accomplish a task (written down), or interpretation of some output (or some other data-related issue). My exams are open-book. This means that you can bring basically anything except old exams, but *you will not have time to search for what you need*. Spend time before the exam organizing the materials you are going to bring, so that when you need to look something up in the exam, *you know exactly where to look*. This is the first run of this course, but the material we have covered so far is almost the same as for STAC32; the "old exams" tab on this website links to old exams for that course. *You need to practice the old midterms* to learn my exam style. I'd recommend starting from the most recent one and working your way backwards in time. Some of the material was different in the past, and some of the coding was also different (the more so the further you go back). Also bear in mind that our midterm is late; whatever we get to in lecture up to and including February 27 is fair game for the exam, which may include material that doesn't appear on old midterms. For that material, PASIAS and assignments are good practice. This will be a Crowdmark exam, which means that the marking will be done online and you will receive instructions to receive your marked exam, also online. (It also means that your exam will have a QR code on each page, and the system will know which page of which exam it is looking at.)

- 2020-02-10 10:00: Our midterm exam is on Wednesday March 4, 17:00--18:45. It is in two rooms (because we have a big class). If your last name starts with A through HS (inclusive), your exam will be in IC 220; if your last name starts with HU through Z (inclusive), your exam will be in IC 130. I am aware that the exam is 1 hour 45 minutes long, and will construct an exam appropriate for the time you have. The rooms are almost full. If you go to the wrong room, you can expect to be sent to the correct one, thereby wasting time you could have spent writing the exam.

- 2020-02-07 15:30: I met with Nnenna this afternoon, and found out where you folks are at. I think you've gotten as far as the matched pairs sign test on page 210, and so I plan to start on Tuesday with Mood's median test on page 211, the story of which begins with some very familiar data. 

- 2020-02-06 10:20: [My solutions to assignment 3](a3-c33.pdf). Full marks in (d), as you see, requires some clear thinking.

- 2020-02-06 10:10: [Assignment 4](a4-c33.pdf) is up on [Quercus](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/135550/assignments/293645).

- 2020-02-04 07:00: did I post the midterm date here? Wed Mar 4 at 17:00 in IC 130 and IC 220.

- 2020-02-03 11:10: I will be back next week! Booked my plane ticket back today.

- 2020-02-03 11:10: draft [Assignment 4](a4-c33.pdf) to be due on the 11th, with one question on the sign test.

- 2020-01-31 11:00 revised 2020-02-03 10:45: my [solutions to assignment 2](a2-c33.pdf). Aasha drew my attention to an error I had made in question 2, which the revised version of the solutions now fixes.

- 2020-01-30 07:00: My solutions to assignment 2 will be here shortly. Assignment 3, due next Tuesday night, is up on Quercus.

- 2020-01-28 08:30: I am temporarily in England. Nnenna Asidianya is teaching in my absence. Look out for messages from her on Quercus.

- 2020-01-22 11:45: [Assignment 2](a2-c33.pdf) is final, and is going up on Quercus in a moment. Two short questions.

- 2020-01-22 10:30: [My solutions to assignment 1](a1-c33.pdf).

- 2020-01-21 14:30: trying to prepare for me being away: a draft [Assignment 3](a3-c33.pdf), due on February 4. This might be doable after Thursday's lecture this week.

- 2020-01-21 13:30: a couple of links: the [Wikipedia page on Welch's test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_t-test), the link on [where that crazy df formula comes from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%E2%80%93Satterthwaite_equation), and [my extended discussion of two-sample $t$](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/pasi-sas.pdf) (starts on page 81). My answer is different from Wikipedia's, which almost certainly means that mine is wrong, but the process is sound.

- 2020-01-21 11:15: On the agenda for this week: two-sample $t$-tests, power of hypothesis tests.

- 2020-01-20 15:30 (edited 2020-01-21 14:00): [Draft assignment 2](a2-c33.pdf). This is on one-sample and two-sample $t$-tests, and will go up on Quercus tomorrow. The power stuff will be on next week's assignment.

- 2020-01-19 17:00: tomorrow's tutorial is a chance to work on [Assignment 1](a1-c33.pdf) with help present. Reminder: if you want to be there for an hour other than the one you're registered for, you can, *if* there is room. 

- 2020-01-16 13:30: [Blue jays data](jays15-home.csv) for today's class.

- 2020-01-13 14:20: [Assignment 1](a1-c33.pdf) is up on Quercus. This should be doable after tomorrow's lecture. 

- 2020-01-13 13:20: for those that were in the 09:00 and 10:00 tutorials, there was supposed to be a place on Quercus to practice handing in your work, and there wasn't. Sorry. There is now, if you want to try it.

- 2020-01-12 10:00: [Material for January 13 tutorial](a0.pdf). Work through this and verify that you get what I got. If you are stuck or confused in tutorial, raise your hand and someone will assist you.

- 2020-01-07 14:00: first lecture was today. There was a mixup with the videorecording, so there is no video of this class. Sorry. There will be videos the rest of the way. Those who were not there should look at the lecture notes: pages 1-16 for the course rules and regulations; pages 17-30 for getting started with R Studio Cloud or pages 31-41 for installing R on your computer; pages 42-54 of reading in data files. (Yes, that is a lot; I went through fast or skipped things.)

- 2019-12-29 17:05: lectures (for those in LEC01) start in week 1 (January 7): Tuesday 12:00-13:00 in IC 220 and Thursday 14:00-15:00 in SW 128. Those enrolled in LEC60 *do not* come to lectures, but watch the video only. There is tutorial space for everyone, LEC01 and LEC60, in BV 498 on Mondays. If you have a choice of tutorials you can attend, consider moving to one where there is more space, such as the 9:00 one, to free up space for others with less choice than you. Tutorials start in week 2 (January 13). The purpose of tutorials is to allow you to work on assignments or other problems with people (TAs or myself) around to help if you get stuck. The first tutorial, you'll work through [a guided introduction to R](a0.pdf). This will prepare you for Assignment 1, which will be due the following week.

- 2019-12-29 17:00: the [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca) page for the course is up. That is where you will hand in assignments and check grades.

- 2019-12-11 12:50: updated lecture notes.

- 2019-06-17 12:20: lecture notes link seems to work.

- 2019-05-29 11:50: a distant hello from the past.
