#  Introduction to Applied Statistics

## Ken Butler

![bad picture](ken.jpg){width=400px}

Welcome to the home page for STAC33. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, announcements etc.) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).

In this course, we learn R, and how to use this software for data organization and to apply statistical methods that you (mostly) already know. I emphasize the communication of the results. That is to say, you need to *get* the answers, but you also need to be able to *explain to others* what the results mean, and *convince others why* what you have done is sensible. This is what a real-world data analyst does, and so you will need to demonstrate an ability to do that as well.


## News (most recent at the top)

- 2021-01-12 11:30: I decided to re-record Lecture 1b to be more detailed and more up-to-date, so the version that's on Quercus now you can watch all of (no need to skip anything). If you happen to have, on your computer, R, R Studio and the `tidyverse` all installed, you are ready to go for this course, but: 
  - if you have everything, you might like to make sure that it is up to date with `update.packages()`),   
  - if you are missing any of those things, watch the video to see how to get hold of what you are missing
  - if you are unfamiliar with R Studio projects and notebooks, watch the video to learn something about these.
  
- 2020-01-11 19:30: sorry, forgot to mention that some of the lectures for this course are the same as those for STAC32, and lecture 1b is one such. (Added: I will do a more careful job of checking for material irrelevant for you.)
- 2020-01-11 15:15: lectures 1a (course outline) and 1b (running R) are now up on Quercus. To find them, look for a Module called Lecture Videos, and in that look for a Page called Week 1. This completes the "Tuesday lecture" for week 1 in this course. Find the lecture slides from the link at the top of the page; the lecture code (if there is any) is linked next to the video. As we go on, there will be two files of code for each video, one from before and one from after (including any changes I made as I recorded the video).
- 2021-01-08 11:20: if you are on the wait list: this is a popular course, and the way to get into it is to enrol early: that is, before the beginning of December. The course has already been enlarged, and the TAs have been hired based on the course at its current size, so it is not possible to enlarge it further.
- 2021-01-06 10:30: small error in course outline corrected. (Thank you to the student who spotted it.)
- 2021-01-05 15:50: in the before-times, the lectures were on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so I will post the recorded lectures labelled with those days, so that you know where you stand. Tutorials start in week 2, so the first one for you will be on Monday January 18.
- 2021-01-05 15:45: course outline should now be updated for 2021.
- 2021-01-05 14:30: This course will be completely in R. If you want to learn some SAS (the material is the same as for this course), see [this website](http://ritsokiguess.site/SAS/).
- 2021-01-04 14:30: the course outline here will need editing to be suitable for this year's version of the course. I will do that later this week.
- 2021-01-04 11:00: here's the plan for the course this year:
  - I will record lectures, 2-3 hours per week, and post the lecture links on Quercus. I will give you practice problems to work on for each lecture.
  - you will also have one hour of tutorial a week (live, on Mondays), where the TA will be available to answer questions and may talk about some of the practice problems.
  - there are *no exams* in this course; instead, you will be graded on weekly assignments (there will be 10, of which your best 8 will count), which will be like mini take-home exams. 
  - grading in this course is based on *demonstrated understanding*; that is, getting the "right answer" (or one of the sensible answers) is necessary but not sufficient. You will need to *explain* how you know it's a sensible answer. This is not a math course. The grader will give you feedback that you can apply to make your next assignment better.

- 2020-12-04 13:00: organizing things for the 2021 online run of this course.
