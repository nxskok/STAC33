#  Introduction to Applied Statistics

## Ken Butler

![bad picture](ken.jpg){width=400px}

Welcome to the home page for STAC33. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).

In this course, we learn R (and at the end SAS), and how to use this software for data organization and to apply statistical methods that you (mostly) already know. I emphasize the communication of the results. That is to say, you need to *get* the answers, but you also need to be able to *explain to others* what the results mean, and *convince others why* what you have done is sensible.

- 2020-01-21 13:30: a couple of links: the [Wikipedia page on Welch's test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_t-test), the link on [where that crazy df formula comes from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%E2%80%93Satterthwaite_equation), and [my extended discussion of two-sample $t$](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/pasi-sas.pdf) (starts on page 81). My answer is different from Wikipedia's, which almost certainly means that mine is wrong, but the process is sound.

- 2020-01-13 13:20: for those that were in the 09:00 and 10:00 tutorials, there was supposed to be a place on Quercus to practice handing in your work, and there wasn't. Sorry. There is now, if you want to try it.

- 2020-01-07 14:00: first lecture was today. There was a mixup with the videorecording, so there is no video of this class. Sorry. There will be videos the rest of the way. Those who were not there should look at the lecture notes: pages 1-16 for the course rules and regulations; pages 17-30 for getting started with R Studio Cloud or pages 31-41 for installing R on your computer; pages 42-54 of reading in data files. (Yes, that is a lot; I went through fast or skipped things.)

- 2019-12-29 17:05: lectures (for those in LEC01) start in week 1 (January 7): Tuesday 12:00-13:00 in IC 220 and Thursday 14:00-15:00 in SW 128. Those enrolled in LEC60 *do not* come to lectures, but watch the video only. There is tutorial space for everyone, LEC01 and LEC60, in BV 498 on Mondays. If you have a choice of tutorials you can attend, consider moving to one where there is more space, such as the 9:00 one, to free up space for others with less choice than you. Tutorials start in week 2 (January 13). The purpose of tutorials is to allow you to work on assignments or other problems with people (TAs or myself) around to help if you get stuck. The first tutorial, you'll work through [a guided introduction to R](a0.pdf). This will prepare you for Assignment 1, which will be due the following week.

- 2019-12-29 17:00: the [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca) page for the course is up. That is where you will hand in assignments and check grades.
