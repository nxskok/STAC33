Welcome to the home page for STAC32. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).

In this course, we learn R (and later SAS), and how to use this software for data organization and to apply statistical methods that you (mostly) already know.
