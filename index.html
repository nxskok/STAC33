<p>Welcome to the home page for STAC33. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, announcements etc.) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on <a href="http://q.utoronto.ca">Quercus</a>.</p>
<p>In this course, we learn R, and how to use this software for data organization and to apply statistical methods that you (mostly) already know. I emphasize the communication of the results. That is to say, you need to <em>get</em> the answers, but you also need to be able to <em>explain to others</em> what the results mean, and <em>convince others why</em> what you have done is sensible. This is what a real-world data analyst does, and so you will need to demonstrate an ability to do that as well.</p>

<h2>News (most recent at the top)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>2021-02-17 13:30: I am just about to release the grades for assignments 2 and 3. If you don’t like your grade, your first port of call should be my solutions: <a href="a2_c33.pdf">assignment 2</a> and <a href="a3_c33.pdf">assignment 3</a>. The TL;DR of the grading scheme is that 8 denotes “competent” work. If something is missing or not accurate enough, expect less (7 for one serious omission or a few small ones, 6 or less for something more serious than that), but if there is evidence that something is well understood or that an explanation is especially clear, then you can get more. If you wish to contest your grade for these assignments, the window for this opens a week from today (Feb 24) and closes two weeks after that (Mar 10). I am seeing that there is some really good work: a 9 or more means that you really know your stuff and can show it.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-02-17 10:15: assignments 2 and 3 are almost finished being graded. It takes a long time, because there are so many of you. In the meanwhile, <a href="a3_c33.pdf">my solutions to assignment 3</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-02-12 13:35: both post-reading-week week 6 lectures are up on Quercus, for when you get to them, and I am currently working on the assignment that will go with them. Assignment 2 is being graded as I write this.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-02-09 14:45: Assignment 1 has been graded, and I will release the marks shortly. I need to remind you of a few things before I do that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the assignments have been graded on the scale in the <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC33/outline_c33_online_slides.pdf">course outline</a>, page 9. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with this grading scale, because it may not be what you are used to.</li>
<li>I am happy that Assignment 1 has been graded according to that scale.</li>
<li>The grader has, as appropriate, added comments to explain the grading and to help you do better on future assignments.</li>
<li>Read through your graded assignment with <a href="a1_c33.pdf">my solutions</a> to understand why you got the grade you did. My solutions have a lot of extra discussion that it is worth your while reading through.</li>
<li>It is not likely that grades will change on appeal, but if you wish to request a re-mark, you need to make a convincing case to me that your work has not been graded according to the grading scheme. “I got everything right” is <em>not</em> a convincing case, because you also need to show your understanding in the original assignment of why it is right (and, besides, in applied statistics there are not right and wrong answers, just answers that show more or less insight and understanding). Re-mark requests must be submitted to me in a window between one and three weeks after the assignment grades are released; for this assignment that means between February 16 and March 2, inclusive. I will not respond to any questions about grades on this assignment before February 16. <em>Do not</em> contact any of the TAs about the grading.</li>
<li>The reason for this grading scheme is that we do not have exams in this course; the assignments are functioning as small take-home exams. The grading scheme rewards excellent work; if you can average a 9, you will get an A+; if you can average a 7, you will get a B-, and so on. But to get those grades, you will have to demonstrate A+ work (or B- work or whatever).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2021-02-08 14:40: Assignment 1 is in process of being graded. I will release the marks when they are all done. Meanwhile, here are <a href="a2_c33.pdf">my assignment 2 solutions</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-02-08 11:35: Well, it seems as if I made only two (or possibly three) mistakes getting the week 5 lectures up. One was failing to attach the Page to the Module (the one where all the videos and links are; thanks to the student who spotted this), and another was getting the material mixed up. Lecture 5c should be on Mood’s Median Test. I think I now have the right lecture up and links to the right things. The material on Analysis of Variance belongs in Lecture 6a, which will be after reading week; that lecture is also up but now in the right place. I probably need to split the slides up a bit more, but you have what you have, with the median test and ANOVA in the same slides but two different lectures.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-02-07 23:15: The week 5 lectures are all up on <a href="q.utoronto.ca">Quercus</a>. I hope all the attendant links are correct, though with my current lack of wakefulness I fear that I messed up some of them. Let me know if anything seems to be out of place. With my shuffling of the order of things, the chapters in <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/pasias/">PASIAS</a> have gotten out of order, but we are doing all of chapters 9 through 12 eventually. I need to look at what is now Lecture 5c and see whether there is too much in there; there seems to be a lot for 46 minutes. I might move some of it to Lecture 6a later. (That would mean being awake enough to work my video editor, which I am certainly not right now.)</p></li>
<li><p>2021-02-06 20:30: <a href="https://twitter.com/JonR1183/status/1358133042531815428">Found on twitter tonight</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-02-05 21:00: I changed my mind about how I wanted to arrange lectures for next week. I decided that I would talk about normal quantile plots first and matched pairs second (having in previous years done it the other way around). On the <a href="notes.html">lecture notes</a> page, you will now see Inference sections 4a and 4b where I treat the two things separately. This means that I will be recording new lectures on this, probably this weekend sometime. It doesn’t change anything about future assignments. A reminder that we have one more week of lectures and tutorials and such, one more assignment, and then it’s reading week and we can take a break (or get caught up, whichever applies to you).</p></li>
<li><p>2021-02-03 10:20: I have tried to organize Assignment 2 so that you can see what you handed in (and you don’t have to get all panicky that it was the wrong thing). The side effect of that is that you may see a “grade” of zero until the grader actually gets to it (which won’t happen until next weekend). There seems not to be a good way to handle this, unfortunately. (When the assignment closes after Thursday night, all the non-grade “grades” will disappear and you will see your real grade when the grader has finished and I release the grades.)</p></li>
<li><p>2021-02-01 11:40: assignment 1 is closed. Here are <a href="a1_c33.pdf">my solutions</a>. You will note a lot of extra comment on what I was expecting to see from you. Remember your aim: not only to get a sensible answer in each case, but to <em>show convincingly</em> that you know <em>why</em> it is sensible. There are also pieces of extra discussion that will offer extra insight about the data you were looking at. Take a look at my solutions with your assignment, to help you understand what we are expecting from you on assignment 2.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-29 13:00: next week’s lectures are up on Quercus. (As I write, the YouTube versions are still processing. They take a bit longer.) As promised, power of tests and sign test. (I could use the lectures I had, so you get them a bit sooner.) I tried to get the links correct for each video, but if anything is mismatched, please let me know.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-28 14:20:</p>
<ul>
<li>I know you don’t want to hear this since you are probably still working on this week’s assignment, but Assignment 2 is now up, on one-sample and two-sample t-tests (the material of this week’s lectures). There are two short questions.</li>
<li>I hope on Assignment 2 you will be able to look at what you handed in and check that it was what you meant. Quercus makes this a bit more ambiguous than I would like, but I think I have worked it out.</li>
<li>Next week’s lectures are on the power of tests, and the sign test. Before I put the lectures up, I need to decide whether I can use the ones I have or whether I need to record new ones (or add new intros or whatever).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2021-01-23 11:45: all the lectures for week 3 (next week) are now up on <a href="http://q.utoronto.ca">Quercus</a>. As always, let me know if any of the multitudinous links point to the wrong place.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-22 21:15: planning ahead a little: there will be two more videos for you in week 3, one about one- and two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-tests in R, which is about an hour long, and one about the bootstrap in the context of inference for means, which is about 30 minutes. The latter is a kind of simple introduction to the bootstrap, which we study in more detail near the end of the course; it provides a nice way to get at “how normal is normal enough?” for these tests.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-22 19:45: I just recorded a new video for you, which (for a change) is me doing actual algebra. This is not about R at all; it’s to provide context for the one- and two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> material that we’ll be looking at in R Studio in week 3. I’m intending it to be a reminder of the distribution theory behind those tests, and also to introduce you to the Welch-Satterthwaite <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test that R uses as the default two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test (as opposed to the pooled test you derived in B57). This is going to be lecture 3a; lecture 3b will be back to me in R Studio doing these tests. My notes are <a href="t-test-notes.pdf">here</a>. (The technology, should you care, is a Wacom graphics tablet with pen, and software called Xournal for Linux that turns this into writing on lined paper.)</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-21 10:40: the Thursday lecture for this week, lecture 2b, is up. I actually put it up last night, but ran out of juice between then and writing about it here. (This also means that I may have messed up some of the links; let me know if that seems to have happened.) I re-used a lecture from the fall, but it talks at the beginning about being “lecture 4” (which you can ignore), so there is a new introduction, recorded last night, on the front of the old video (which is otherwise good). I now know how to use my software to join two videos together. Cutting things out is still more of a challenge.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-20 19:30:</p>
<ul>
<li>I took a spin through the “Assignment 0” that were handed in. If it looked something like an answer to the questions, you’ll see “yep”; if it looked like something else, I said what I saw. (In that case, check that what you handed in was what you meant to hand in. There were a couple of things that looked as if you meant to hand in something else.)</li>
<li>Lecture 2b is going up tonight (if I can summon up the energy) or tomorrow (otherwise). The first assignment, due a week from tomorrow, will include from the beginning up to and including Lecture 2b.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2021-01-18 14:00: Lecture 2a, on making graphs, is now up on Quercus and all the other places. The links to all these other places are on the Quercus Week 2 Lecture Videos page, which is itself in the Lecture Videos Module. I think. There are so many ways the lecture videos now need to be accessible that I am bound to forget some; remind me if I forget. On YouTube the lecture videos are “unlisted”, meaning that the only way to find them is via the link on the Quercus page. I don’t know whether that means you can also find them by subscribing to my YouTube channel or not. (I suspect not.) I would prefer to limit access, for now, to people registered in this course.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-17 21:00: <a href="https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/learnonline/chapter/chapter-1/">some reading</a> about online learning.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-16 22:00: I was really supposed to be not working today, but one of our number wondered where the slides were for the lecture videos, and I realized I had deleted the links to them while putting in the links to YouTube and for downloads. They are now back. In the week 1 lecture videos page, above the video viewer you will now see links for downloading, watching on YouTube, the lecture slides, the code I ran (usually there will also be links to the “after” code containing my edits during lecture as well), and some problems in PASIAS to work through. I hope that’s everything now, though at this point on a Saturday night it is quite likely that I have forgotten something else.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-15 21:20: here is a suggested schedule for you for this course, something to give you some structure that you may be lacking because of not having lectures to show up for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday: go to tutorial. If you like, spend some time afterwards thinking about what you learned there.</li>
<li>Tuesday: Watch the Tuesday lecture(s). Make a note of any questions you have. Pick a time between now and Thursday that you will use to do your assignment (you will need to set aside three hours or so).</li>
<li>Wednesday: work through the PASIAS problems for Tuesday’s lecture</li>
<li>Thursday: Watch the Thursday lecture(s). Make a note of questions.</li>
<li>Friday: work through the PASIAS problems for Thursday’s lecture. Think about what does and does not make sense from the week’s lectures and PASIAS problems, and be prepared to ask questions in tutorial.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assignments are available on Tuesday morning and are due Thursday at 11:59pm. The first one will be due on January 28. I wanted to give you an extra week to get used to things first. Each assignment will be based on the material in the previous week of lectures (or maybe the previous two weeks in the case of the first assignment.)</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-15 21:00: if you look in on Quercus, you should see an announcement about Monday’s tutorials, with all the information you need to access yours, who your TAs will be, and so on. There are two TAs allocated to each tutorial, to improve your chances of getting timely help if you run into problems. For this kind of work, if you are having trouble, it really helps the TA if you share your screen, which you can do without needing to have your camera on.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-14 20:00:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the discussion forum, I asked whether anyone had any preferences for video format. I’ve had requests for being able to download the videos and for being able to watch them on Youtube. I am happy to honour both of those. If you go to the <a href="https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/199499/pages/week-1">week 1 videos page</a>, you’ll now see, next to the lecture number and title, options to download the lecture directly to your computer (as an <code>.mp4</code> file) and to watch it on YouTube, where you have options to do crazy stuff like watching me at double speed, should that be your wish.</li>
<li>if you have a shaky internet connection, or you are a long way away, I recommend downloading the videos. Just click the link and the video will be saved on your computer. You can then watch them without having to be online (or needing your connection to stay up the whole time). Whatever video app you can find should be able to play <code>.mp4</code> files. If you’re looking for a video app, I recommend <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">VLC</a>, which seems to run on just about anything, including Android. (However, if you watch the lecture videos on your phone you might find the code in R Studio a bit small to read!)</li>
<li>in case you are confused, <code>mymedia</code> is the place where my videos are stored (at the U of T library). If you click on the video viewer in Quercus, that is where it is streamed from, and if you download the video, that’s where it’s downloaded from. What prompted all of this is something a colleague said to me: “Yes, video streaming off of quercus via mymedia can be painful: both on the student connection side and on [the] UofT side.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2021-01-12 15:30: in the time between the last note and now, I have learned enough about video-editing software to fashion a Lecture 1c (Thursday’s lecture) out of a new introduction and most of a previously-recorded lecture that I think no longer contains any irrelevant stuff. Once you have watched and played along with Lecture 1b, which will get you used to running R and handling Notebooks, you can play along with Lecture 1c by downloading the code (link on Quercus next to the video), copy-pasting it into a notebook on your account, and running the code along with me. There will be two versions of the code, one from before the lecture, and one from after with the code as modified during the lecture. Also you will see a link to the appropriate problems in <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/pasias/">PASIAS</a> for you to practice with (solutions are after the problems). The problems for Lecture 1c contain reading in data and also drawing graphs (Lecture 2a), so you can hold off on the graph-drawing for now. (That is next week’s first lecture.)</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-12 11:30: I decided to re-record Lecture 1b to be more detailed and more up-to-date, so the version that’s on Quercus now you can watch all of (no need to skip anything). If you happen to have, on your computer, R, R Studio and the <code>tidyverse</code> all installed, you are ready to go for this course, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have everything, you might like to make sure that it is up to date with <code>update.packages()</code>),<br />
</li>
<li>if you are missing any of those things, watch the video to see how to get hold of what you are missing</li>
<li>if you are unfamiliar with R Studio projects and notebooks, watch the video to learn something about these.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2020-01-11 19:30: sorry, forgot to mention that some of the lectures for this course are the same as those for STAC32, and lecture 1b is one such. (Added: I will do a more careful job of checking for material irrelevant for you.)</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-11 15:15: lectures 1a (course outline) and 1b (running R) are now up on Quercus. To find them, look for a Module called Lecture Videos, and in that look for a Page called Week 1. This completes the “Tuesday lecture” for week 1 in this course. Find the lecture slides from the link at the top of the page; the lecture code (if there is any) is linked next to the video. As we go on, there will be two files of code for each video, one from before and one from after (including any changes I made as I recorded the video).</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-08 11:20: if you are on the wait list: this is a popular course, and the way to get into it is to enrol early: that is, before the beginning of December. The course has already been enlarged, and the TAs have been hired based on the course at its current size, so it is not possible to enlarge it further.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-06 10:30: small error in course outline corrected. (Thank you to the student who spotted it.)</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-05 15:50: in the before-times, the lectures were on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so I will post the recorded lectures labelled with those days, so that you know where you stand. Tutorials start in week 2, so the first one for you will be on Monday January 18.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-05 15:45: course outline should now be updated for 2021.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-05 14:30: This course will be completely in R. If you want to learn some SAS (the material is the same as for this course), see <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/SAS/">this website</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-04 14:30: the course outline here will need editing to be suitable for this year’s version of the course. I will do that later this week.</p></li>
<li><p>2021-01-04 11:00: here’s the plan for the course this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will record lectures, 2-3 hours per week, and post the lecture links on Quercus. I will give you practice problems to work on for each lecture.</li>
<li>you will also have one hour of tutorial a week (live, on Mondays), where the TA will be available to answer questions and may talk about some of the practice problems.</li>
<li>there are <em>no exams</em> in this course; instead, you will be graded on weekly assignments (there will be 10, of which your best 8 will count), which will be like mini take-home exams.</li>
<li>grading in this course is based on <em>demonstrated understanding</em>; that is, getting the “right answer” (or one of the sensible answers) is necessary but not sufficient. You will need to <em>explain</em> how you know it’s a sensible answer. This is not a math course. The grader will give you feedback that you can apply to make your next assignment better.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2020-12-04 13:00: organizing things for the 2021 online run of this course.</p></li>
</ul>
